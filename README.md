<h1>Self Organizing Map For Word Clustering</h1>

Implementation of the self-organizing map (SOMs) algorithm with competitive learning using Python. The SOMs algorithm aims to cluster words belonging to four categories: animals, countries, fruits, and veggies. The algorithm is trained on the word embeddings taken from the pre-trained Global Vectors (GloVe).
